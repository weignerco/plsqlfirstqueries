ssh -i vm-02-prv.key -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -i vm-01.prv.key opc@<vm-01 public ip>" opc@<vm-02 private ip>

# The command is a classic SSH proxying example, perfect for hopping into a private VM-02 via a public one VM-01 (a bastion host)

# vm-02-prv.key: Private key for VM-02 (the private instance).
# vm-01.prv.key: Private key for VM-01 (the bastion host).
# ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p ...": Tells SSH to forward traffic to VM-02 through VM-01.
# %h:%p: These are placeholdersâ€”SSH substitutes them with the target host (<vm-02 private ip>) and port (22 by default).
# opc@<vm-01 public ip>: SSH login for the bastion host.
